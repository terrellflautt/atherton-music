"Atherton's mighty voice is powered by that secret source of emotion, the one which cannot be questioned."

**Margaret Moser (Austin Chronicle):**
"When it comes to barn-burning vocalists from Austin, Texas, they don't come any hotter than Leeann Atherton. She's got Southern fireball pipes that don't quit and an indefatigable spirit."

**Lee Zimmerman (Goldmine):**
"A singular talent, a woman who easily navigates between a variety of genres and manages to avoid being typecast in any one in particular."

**Raoul Hernandez (Austin Chronicle):**
"Janis Joplin – Earth mother oracle. South Austin's harvested a few such natural wonders over the past 50 or so. Leeann Atherton channels all of them on Fallen Angel."
