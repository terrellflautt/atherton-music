  tagline: "God speaks, we listen, Atherton sings.",

  intro: `Atherton is a mother-son duo rooted in the heart of Texas, where country blues meets the power of gospel. Their music carries the spirit of the South—raw, honest, and deeply felt—blending Americana, soul, and the timeless tradition of good God gospel music.`,

  leeannStory: `Leeann Atherton's voice is a force of nature. Born in Birmingham, Alabama, and raised in Charleston, South Carolina, she was shaped by southern gospel sung by her mother, the hippie festivals of the '70s where she first heard Janis Joplin and the Allman Brothers, and the rich tradition of South Carolina island spirituals.

Her musical journey took her from the beaches of Charleston—where she put herself through college singing in dance bands—to the honky-tonks of Nashville, and finally to Austin, Texas, where she found her true home. It was at Antone's, Austin's legendary blues club, where everything clicked. The city's spirit of musical freedom and authentic expression matched the fire she'd been carrying since she was a teenager hitchhiking cross-country chasing live music.

Critics have compared her mighty vocals to Bonnie Raitt's grit, Billie Holiday's soulful restraint, and Janis Joplin's raw power. Bill Bentley of Americana Highways wrote that Atherton's voice is "powered by that secret source of emotion, the one which cannot be questioned." The Austin Chronicle calls her a "barn-burning vocalist from Austin" with "southern fireball pipes that don't quit." Her sound is equal parts honey and gunpowder—capable of shaking your body while lifting your spirit.`,

  musicalJourney: `Over her career spanning multiple decades, Leeann has released eight acclaimed albums. Her work with legendary producer Rich Brotherton at Willie Nelson's Pedernales Studio yielded "Only Glory" and the chart-topping "Lady Liberty," which hit #1 on independent Americana charts. Her latest full-band album "Fallen Angel" showcases her extensive emotional range, from the euphoric "Smack Dab in a Miracle" to the politically charged "Cleaning House."

The album's closing track, "Motherless Children's Club," recorded a cappella at her mother's memorial service, reveals the spiritual depth that has always run through her music—a connection to something larger than ourselves.`,

  motherSonDuo: `Atherton Music represents the evolution of Leeann's musical vision into a powerful family collaboration. As a mother-son duo, they blend generations of Texas songwriter tradition with contemporary gospel energy. Their repertoire spans from foot-stomping country blues to soul-stirring gospel hymns, all delivered with the authenticity that comes from living the music, not just performing it.`,

  currentChapter: `Today, Atherton is preparing to bring their gospel message to new audiences with an upcoming Spain tour and the December 15th release of their new gospel album. This chapter emphasizes their commitment to "good God gospel"—music that celebrates faith, community, and the transformative power of song.

Their Full Moon Barn Dances in Austin have become legendary community gatherings—outdoor celebrations featuring food, friends, and musicians from around the world dancing under the Texas stars. These events embody the Atherton spirit: music as a force that brings people together, breaks down barriers, and creates moments of shared joy and transcendence.`,

  philosophy: `When asked about what she experiences while performing, Leeann describes it as being "connected with the universal energy like God...in a god-state where you are connected with all the others." She wants to be remembered as "a warm facilitator that brought folks together emotionally and in other ways, together to experience that same feeling."

This is the heart of Atherton Music: not just entertainment, but communion. Not just songs, but truth. As their tagline declares—God speaks, we listen, Atherton sings.`,
